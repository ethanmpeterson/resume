\begin{rSection}{Extracurricular Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Queen's Formula SAE}{September 2018 - Present}{Electrical
    Team - Senior Member}{Kingston, Ontario}
\item Architect of the CAN Bus network employed on the 2020 vehicle. Wrote a
  custom CAN library in C++ to allow other team members to easily access CAN
  data in their respective software projects.
\item Selected addresses for each CAN message to ensure that important data had
  higher priority.
\item Solved an issue in the dashboard design where the MCU in use could not
  transmit CAN messages. Added a second MCU to the PCB to handle CAN tasks
  allowing the team to keep the existing dashboard code leading up to
  competition. The two MCUs on the board were linked using UART and a custom
  communication protocol was implemented with Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing
  (COBS) to ensure data integrity.
\item Currently in the process of moving all MCUs on the car from AVR to ARM
  architecture, making use of increased speed and greater peripheral selection.
